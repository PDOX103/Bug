It is an assignment project of Software Development-I Lab (CSE 1200) course. 

The project is:

Write a program using igraphics and make a demo graphics for your game.
1. You must have a screen of 1000(width} by 600(height) for your mini demo game.
2. A background image of your own choice must be added.
3. In the foreground, take your favorite character as an image and place it to the middle.
And try to handle moving the character through both keyboard and mouse. (for
mouse, either use iMouseMove or iPassiveMouse )
4. Take a border in the foreground. This border can be drawn using four Rectangles in
iDraw() or your own image that you want to use.
5. If your character is inside the border, it’ll show “Inside The Border”; if outside, then
it’ll show “Outside The Border”. If your character is in touch with the border, it’ll
show “Border Hit”.
